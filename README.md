# Monte Carlo Stock & Option Simulator

Interactive Python app built with **Streamlit**, modelling stock prices under **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and visualising multiple stochastic paths. The simulator demonstrates the use of **Monte Carlo methods** in financial modelling, exploring randomness, volatility, and expected return in a controlled, data-driven environment.

- Terminal price distribution histogram with key summary statistics:
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, range
  - Expected growth and return
  - Probability of exceeding or falling below thresholds
- Clean interface with organised tabs for simulation and analysis.
- Placeholder tabs for upcoming modules:
  - Monte Carlo Option Pricing
  - Black‚ÄìScholes Analytical Comparison
  - Convergence Analysis
- Built with **Streamlit**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.
